WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

## Installation:

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command: on git bash, 'node index.js  use the terminal 'npm install to install dependecies.and use the command'npm install --save-dev jest to install jest as a devdependency.

## Usage:
You will use command line to use this application, node.js  installed by typing 'node -v', then 'node index.js', use inquirer for series of questions by prompt, follow up all question, select shape and color to your choise and choose three charactors for logo.once all prompts will be answered new logo will be generated with the file name logo.svg.follow the steps in the demo link.

## Contribution;
Below of this page, there are my contact information provided, you cantact me for more ideas or requests.

## Testing:
The application must include `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes in a parent `Shape` class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.
